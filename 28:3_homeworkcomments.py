#write a script that reads the file, picks the geometries, and define a style for polygons, and a style for 
#try to draw them on a canvas
#from the type, you have to collect all the geometries, and then you can just loop over the different lines, and assign the particular style 



#second one, create a UTM grid
#create a grid of a certain size, and then color theme
#this will be a nested loop- you will loop over longitudes, and for each longitude, you will have to create the

# it should cover in degrees from -180 to 180


#** but start with this one- create six geometries (polygons, lines, points) and name them how they're named on the "create a test set" slide
